🧠 About the Project – SciBot
SciBot is an AI-powered research companion built to make reading, understanding, and interacting with scientific documents easier and smarter. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with advanced LLMs (like OpenAI/Gemini) to provide instant summaries and contextual answers — all from your own uploaded documents.

✨ What SciBot Can Do:

• Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
• Instantly generate concise summaries of complex papers
• Ask natural language questions and get intelligent answers
• Retrieve accurate, context-backed responses with citations
• Use a modern, interactive web UI built with Streamlit

🎯 Who It's For:

• Students trying to decode dense academic papers
• Researchers managing multiple sources of information
• Professionals needing quick insights from technical content

🛠️ Tech Stack:

• Streamlit – clean and reactive UI
• ChromaDB – vector storage and similarity search
• OpenAI / Gemini – LLMs for Q&A and summarization
• Python – backend, chunking, parsing, and API handling

💡 SciBot is designed to help you save time, learn faster, and explore research like never before.
